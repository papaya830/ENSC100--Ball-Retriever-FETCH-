Code used in the ENSC 100 - FETCH! project

The objective of this project was to create a device that would return a hockey ball to a solo player to remove the hassle of fetching the ball themselves. 
Ramps were designed for the ball to be returned passively. 

This Arduino code is used to control the mechanical lifting piece which was controlled by the linear actuator and ultrasonic sensor.
The original design attempts included using an IR receiver and manual control with a button clicker.
